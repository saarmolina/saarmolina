### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
I'm Highly motivated second-year Computer Science student at Tel Aviv University. Passionate about delivering impact, teamwork, and tackling intricate challenges.
I'm  eager to explore new technologies and to leverage my quick self-learning capabilities, creativity, and
technical skills in a dynamic environment.

### üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on, which showcase my skills and interests in various areas of computer science:

- **AVLTreeList**: This project is a Python implementation of an AVL Tree List, showcasing advanced skills in data structure manipulation and algorithm design. It highlights my understanding of self-balancing binary search trees, particularly AVL trees, and their use in efficiently maintaining sorted data structures. The implementation covers key computer science concepts, including tree rotations, balance factor maintenance, and operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups, all achieving optimal time complexity.

- **BinomialHeap**: This project delves into the implementation and analysis of Fibonacci Heaps in Java, underscoring my proficiency in algorithm implementation and data structure optimization. It highlights my capability to tackle complex algorithmic challenges, demonstrating a deep understanding of advanced data structures. Through this project, I showcase my skills in managing priority queues efficiently and applying theoretical concepts to practical coding scenarios, emphasizing key operations such as insertion, deletion, and decrease key, all optimized for improved performance.

- **Controller**: This control software allows extensive control over another computer. The controlling side can fully monitor the activity of the controlled computer and perform various operations on it. The system consists of two parts: a server and a client, where the controlled computer is the server and the controlling computer is the client. I developed the project using the Python programming language. It is based on the following modules: Wx, Time, Socket, PIL, Thread, Win32api, Win32con, and OS. The software needs to run on Windows and requires a connection to a local area network (LAN).

- **Car Race Game**: This project is a computer game where the player navigates a car through an obstacle course, written in Assembly language. The game challenges players to control the car's movement precisely to avoid various obstacles and reach the finish line. Developing the game in Assembly allowed for a deep understanding of low-level programming and hardware interaction, optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay. The project includes intricate details like collision detection, scoring mechanisms, and dynamic level progression.
