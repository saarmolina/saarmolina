### 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a highly motivated second-year Computer Science student at Tel Aviv University. Passionate about delivering impact, teamwork, and tackling intricate challenges.
I'm  eager to explore new technologies and to leverage my quick self-learning capabilities, creativity, and
technical skills in a dynamic environment.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **AVLTreeList**: A Python implementation of an AVL Tree List. Required understanding of self-balancing binary search trees, particularly AVL trees, and their use in efficiently maintaining sorted data structures. The implementation covers key computer science concepts, including tree rotations, balance factor maintenance, and operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups, all achieving optimal time complexity.

- **BinomialHeap**: A Java implementation of Binomial Heaps. Required a deep understanding of managing priority queues efficiently and applying theoretical concepts to practical coding scenarios, emphasizing key operations such as insertion, deletion, and decrease key, all optimized for improved performance.

- **Controller**: This control software allows extensive control over another computer, enabling the controlling side to fully monitor the activity of the controlled machine and perform various operations. The system consists of two parts: a server (running on the controlled computer) and a client (on the controlling computer). Developed using Python, this software currently works on macOS and requires a connection to a local area network (LAN).

- **Car Race Game**: This project is a computer game where the player navigates a car through an obstacle course, written in Assembly language and implements graphical game in DOS using BIOS interrupts. The game challenges players to control the car's movement precisely to avoid various obstacles and reach the finish line. The game features player movement and obstacle collision detection, and it includes mechanisms for handling keyboard input and screen rendering. Developing the game in Assembly allowed for a deep understanding of low-level programming and hardware interaction, optimizing performance to ensure smooth gameplay. The project includes intricate details like collision detection, scoring mechanisms, and dynamic level progression.
