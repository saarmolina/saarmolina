### 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I'm a highly motivated second-year Computer Science student at Tel Aviv University. Passionate about delivering impact, teamwork, and tackling intricate challenges.
I'm  eager to explore new technologies and to leverage my quick self-learning capabilities, creativity, and
technical skills in a dynamic environment.

### 🚀 Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **AVLTreeList**: A Python implementation of an AVL Tree List. Required understanding of self-balancing binary search trees, particularly AVL trees, and their use in efficiently maintaining sorted data structures. The implementation covers key computer science concepts, including tree rotations, balance factor maintenance, and operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups, all achieving optimal time complexity.

- **BinomialHeap**: A Java implementation of Binomial Heaps. Required a deep understanding of managing priority queues efficiently and applying theoretical concepts to practical coding scenarios, emphasizing key operations such as insertion, deletion, and decrease key, all optimized for improved performance.
