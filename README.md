# Symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization (symNMF) Clustering

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
I'm a highly motivated second-year Computer Science student at Tel Aviv University. Passionate about delivering impact, teamwork, and tackling intricate challenges.
I'm eager to explore new technologies and to leverage my quick self-learning capabilities, creativity, and
technical skills in a dynamic environment.

### üöÄ Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:
- **symNMF Clustering**: Implementation of a clustering algorithm based on symmetric Non-negative Matrix Factorization, combining Python and C for optimal performance. Features include similarity matrix computation, cluster optimization, and performance comparison with K-means clustering.
- **K-means Clustering**: Developed a comprehensive implementation of the K-means clustering algorithm in both C and Python. The project features efficient handling of multi-dimensional data points, dynamic memory management in C, optimized Python list comprehensions, and robust error handling. Key features include customizable cluster numbers, convergence detection, and support for large datasets through efficient data structures.
- **AVLTreeList**: A Python implementation of an AVL Tree List. Required understanding of self-balancing binary search trees, particularly AVL trees, and their use in efficiently maintaining sorted data structures. The implementation covers key computer science concepts, including tree rotations, balance factor maintenance, and operations such as insertions, deletions, and lookups, all achieving optimal time complexity.
- **BinomialHeap**: A Java implementation of Binomial Heaps. Required a deep understanding of managing priority queues efficiently and applying theoretical concepts to practical coding scenarios, emphasizing key operations such as insertion, deletion, and decrease key, all optimized for improved performance.
